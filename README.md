## Mini Project 1- Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

### Project Description
<p> In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected. This project assumes that you are familiar with python and pandas DataFrames. You can learn the required skills in these courses:<p>

## Mini Project 2

### Problem
<p> Our client is a credit card company. They have brought us a dataset that includes some demographics and recent financial data (the past six months) for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders. This data is at the credit account level; in other words, there is one row for each account (you should always clarify what the definition of a row is, in a dataset). Rows are labeled by whether in the next month after the six month historical data period, an account owner has defaulted, or in other words, failed to make the minimum payment.<p>

## Final Project 
<p> While the rate of fatal road accidents has been decreasing steadily since the 80s, the past ten years have seen a stagnation in this reduction. Coupled with the increase in number of miles driven in the nation, the total number of traffic related-fatalities has now reached a ten year high and is rapidly increasing.

By looking at the demographics of traï¬ƒc accident victims for each US state, we find that there is a lot of variation between states. Now we want to understand if there are patterns in this variation in order to derive suggestions for a policy action plan. In particular, instead of implementing a costly nation-wide plan we want to focus on groups of states with similar profiles. How can we find such groups in a statistically sound way and communicate the result effectively?</p>
